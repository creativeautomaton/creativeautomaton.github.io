**― Herman Melville**,  The Whale 

Using GIT solely from the frontend using Javascript is no simple feat. Creating a client facing CMS using only JSON and encryption with auth tokens also brings a decent learning curve. What I am attempting to do is combine these too seperate development ideas into one. 

At the moment the project is called GIT-CMS and aims to provide githubpages  with a secure and easy to use CMS in order to build out static sites from the web not only relying on hosting a local version to easily manage content like [this jekyll-admin ruby GEM](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin).
